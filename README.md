### EV Hub Location Analysis Using Power BI and QGIS:

- This is a mock proposal for the investment in an EV charging hub for a companyâ€™s CEO to make a data-driven 
	decision on an ideal location for the hub and ensure the appropriate number of EV chargers to be installed 
	to meet the anticipated customer volume at a tourist attraction or along a motorway.
- The analyses are made based on datasets such as annual historical demand data for EVs, traffic data of main roads, 
  existing number of EV charging devices, fixed costs to build the hub, expected charging costs and sales, 
	and additional income streams.
- Apart from the native visuals in Power BI such as the line chart, the column chart, and the ArcGIS visual,
  QGIS is used to visualize England by region, the tourist attractions, main roads, and motorways.
- Based on the analyses,one tourist attraction and one motorway are recommended for the CEO to make the final decision.
